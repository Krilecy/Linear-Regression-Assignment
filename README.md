Answers to the linear regression assignment for the IIIT-LJMU masters ML&AI

## Case
The US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for shared bikes. 

The company wants to know:
- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands

## Assignemt:
We were required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available dataset. This includes prepering the data, building a model and evaluate/improve it.
